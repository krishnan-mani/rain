- Support the lifecycle of individual and related CloudFormation stacks by environment
- For any specified environments, act on the stacks with the desired action
- Currently for each environment, only one region can be specified
- For any specified contexts, act on each context
- Support workflows with actions including create, recreate, update-only, and create-change-set

  - create: Test whether the stack exists. If not, create it
  - recreate: If the stack exists in any state, delete it and create again. If it does not exist, create it. 
  - update-only: Only update the stack (if it is in a good state)
  - create-change-set: Only create a change-set for the stack (when it is in a good state).   
  - Report an error if the stack is not in a good state when an action is attempted or completed.
  - If changes are in progress when an action is attempted, retry multiple times with a delay, then timeout and report an error.

- Use with single stacks: no context or environment, single context or environment, multiple contexts or environments, both contexts and environments
- Use with multiple stacks
- Assemble parameters from multiple sources
- Work with contexts
- Work with environments
- Turn validate output into a starter file for parameters and infer capabilities
- Describe outputs
- Persist and retrieve confidential information from a trust store
- Acknowledge the capabilities required by the template to create the stack (CAPABILITY_IAM, CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM)
- Copy template to S3 location when required
- Support the creation of nested stacks
- [TBD] dependencies between stacks, environments, and templates
- [TBD] multi-account
- [TBD] multi-region
